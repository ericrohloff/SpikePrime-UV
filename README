## UV Activity

This activity is designed to be used with the LEGO Spike Prime and the PicoW
with grove UV Sensor. The primary purpose of this activity is to get students
involved with Big Data and how it can be used to make decisions. By using data
from a UV sensor, historical data, and an API, students will be able to use data
science techniques to make decisions based on the data. The primary age group
for this activity is 12-18 years old.

## Big Data: UV Index with the Lego Spike Prime and PicoW

This activity is designed to be used with the LEGO Spike Prime and the PicoW
with grove UV Sensor. The primary purpose of this activity is to get students
involved with Big Data and how it can be used to make decisions. By using data

science techniques to make decisions based on the data. The primary age group
for this activity is 12-18 years old.
